	This is a jazz version of a Jewish song called Bilvavi (more traditional version <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVv7K-TqRcY" 
	target="_blank">here</a>). I recorded this as a jazz waltz with a piano, bass, and drums. I played each instrument on my keyboard using GarageBand.

	I find Bilvavi to be a very beautiful melody, and I think it lends itself to jazz nicely. This was recorded back in 2008, and I 
	think my jazz playing has improved a lot since then. While I look back fondly on much of the music I've recorded, I tend to be
	quite critical of some of my more traditional jazz piano playing. Although this is not a jazz standard, it is played in a pretty
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-ahead_jazz" target="_blank">straight-ahead jazz</a> style.

	The form of the song is AABB. I first play the melody, then take a piano solo, then a bass solo, then the piano improvises a bit 
	more and plays the melody out. There is an intro and an outro that I put together (they are essentially the same).
