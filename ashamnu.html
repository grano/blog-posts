I recorded this song on GarageBand in 2009. It is an interpretation of a prayer recited on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, commonly known as <a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_in_Judaism#Ashamnu.2C_the_short_confession">Ashamnu</a>. You can hear the melody I am playing in its more commonly recognizable form <a target="blank" href="/static/music/ashamnu-original.mp3">here</a>.

Arrangement:
</b></p>

<p>
This is meant to be a piano trio (piano, upright bass, and drums), with the upright bass using the bow for the entire song, and the drummer using a combination of mallets and brushes (this sound was harder to recreate on GarageBand). It is free form and out of time, periodically switching between the “verse”, “chorus”, and improvisations on the theme.

Unfortunately, I hardly remember recording this, so I can only have a best guess. A primary motivation for this recording is certainly the prayer and melody itself. Two of my favorite Coltrane ballads are <a target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je2tpX6Z-QA">After the Rain</a> and <a target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMy4FR_EY">Dear Lord</a> <a href="#1">[1]</a>. I still play a lot of songs in the style of this Ashamnu recording, and I think Coltrane’s ballads are a strong influence (After the Rain is probably more representative).

[1] Side note: if you have never listened to these songs, take 10 minutes, turn up the speakers, close your eyes, and enjoy (preferably listening to a higher quality recording than YouTube). Another side note: Kenny Garrett’s album <a target="blank" href="https://myspace.com/kennygarrettofficial/music/album/pursuance-the-music-of-john-coltrane-15199713">"Pursuance: The Music of John Coltrane"</a> has very beautiful versions of After the Rain and Dear Lord.
