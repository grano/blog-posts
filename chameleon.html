	Yes, it's overplayed. And yes, it's  easy to improvise over. But I'm posting this version of Chameleon by Herbie Hancock anyway (listen 
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbkqE4fpvdI" target="_blank">here</a> for Herbie Hancock's original recording).

	This was one of the first songs I recorded on GarageBand. I had previously been using Cakewalk (an old MIDI Sequencer). Although Cakewalk served me well,
	it had some shortcomings (I will post some of my old Cakewalk recordings in due time). Cakewalk only includes the 128 General MIDI sounds. And the 
	recording quality - based on my setup at least - was very poor.

<p>
	In contrast, I owned all of the GarageBand jam packs, which provided a slew of fun instruments to play. And there is an easy way to export your GarageBand song
	as an mp3 in a higher quality than I was used to with Cakewalk.

	This recording is me having fun with some of the new instruments at my disposal. I recorded the iconic bass line on a "Science Bass" sound and looped it. I added a
	GarageBand loop drum beat (I still struggle with the keyboard drums). Then I have fun playing over this groove with three progressively unique sounds.

	I start with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_piano" target="_balnk">Fender Rhodes</a> (sadly, I have never played a <i>real</i> Fender Rhodes). Next, things get a bit more strange with the "Old Wave" sound (this is my personal favorite solo on this 
	recording). I end with the somewhat out-there "Electroclash Lead" sound.

	When I first revisited this version of Chameleon years after originally recording it, some out of time phrases irked me. Yet after a few more listens,
	I looked back fondly at a time when I was just having fun experimenting with a seemingly endless supply of fun new sounds.
