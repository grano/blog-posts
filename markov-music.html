	I've always enjoyed music discovery services. When a new service is launched, 
	I've been known to spend hours playing around seeing what new music the service 
	can find for me. So I figured it would be fun to build my own music / artist discovery service. 
	I call it Markov Music.

	When you type something into the search bar, we try and match this search term 
	to a known person. Using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> 
	database, we then look for other artists that influenced and were influenced by the artist 
	you entered. After showing you a YouTube video of this artist, we'll randomly select another 
	artist from the list of influenced and influenced by. And so forth and so on. Hence the name 
	Markov Music - the artist selection technique forms a <a target="_blank" 
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chain</a>.
