	This is a little melody I composed and recorded back in 2010. It was inspired by some of the beautiful melodies on Andy Statman's <i>The Hidden Light</i>
	(<a href="https://myspace.com/andy.statman.bruce.barth/music/album/the-hidden-light-8166242" target="_blank">link</a> to listen to this album on the New Myspace).

	You'll hear an electric bass, an acoustic piano, and an Irish Bouzoukith. What I really wanted was
	a mandolin sound, but the Bouzouki was the closest I could find. I first
	play the melody on the Irish Bouzouki, then the piano and Bouzouki alternate some improvisations, and the the Bouzouki closes with the melody once more.

	Although I had this saved in my computer with a title of "Klezmer 10", I admit it is not the most Klezmer sounding song. 
	I am leaving the title for posterity, but am making no statement on the genre of this song.
