	I've never bothered naming any of the songs I've composed (as you might have observed by the fact that all of the songs I have posted are 
	instrumental, I am better at expressing myself through instrumental music than through words). As a name is needed to save a file on a computer, 
	I've always simply categorized the song along with an index when first clicking Save. "Jazz 14", "Pop 3", "Movie Theme 1". 
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes a song eludes a simple categorization. Without much thought, I simply assign a new classification to these songs.

	This song is a good example. It's not really Klezmer. In its original form, this song was quite rhythmic (although the rhythmic aspect is understated in the version I've posted here).
	Hence the name "Klezmer Rhythmic 1". <a href="#1">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>
	In my original recording, I recorded a vamp of the song's chords with a rhythmic beat and bass line behind it. I then improvised a few
	melodies on top of it. In the years since my original sketch of a recording, I fused these improvised melodies into a single cohesive melody.
</p>
<p>
	This version is a duo of piano and Flamenco Guitar. I'm unsure why the Flamenco Guitar entered the scene, but it seems to fit. It seems to give the song
	a bit of a Spanish flair. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
	I play the melody once on the Flamenco Guitar sound (beginning around :20), and then the Flamenco Guitar improvises (beginning around :56), with a bit of interplay with the piano. To mimic the feeling of two
	musicians playing off each other, I recorded multiple takes of each track, alternating between each instrument progressively. This way I can begin to anticipate the other instrument's phrase.
	To end the Guitar's improvisation section, I play the final section of the melody (you'll hear this at 2:47). Next, the piano solos (a true solo). Then the Flamenco Guitar closes with the melody at 4:46.

		[1] Of course I added "1" just in case there were more to come. Currently, this is my only song in the "Klezmer Rhythmic" genre.

		[2] It's interesting how the sound coming out of the instrument you are playing impacts the way you play the instrument. This is an easy exercise on a keyboard,
		simply because a keyboard can play so many sounds. I would be interested to hear if other instrumentalists feel similarly.
