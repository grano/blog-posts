	This one is a little weird. I'm not really sure what motivated this funk-jazz fusion rendition of the Sesame Street theme song.
	I do know I went through a jazz fusion phase. But don't ask me why Sunny Days received this treatment.

	Looking back, my favorite part is the electric guitar solo that begins around 1:36. I also enjoy the somewhat random transition to
	the twelve bar blues in swing around 3:33. Despite the unfitting nature of this ending, I enjoy the couple choruses of blues that ended the song.
	The Sunny Days interpretation is dissonant at times, which gives the song a dark feel. Perhaps this harshness is what motivated me to 
	go into a much happier twelve bar blues feel to end the song.

	I recorded this on GarageBand. I played all of the instruments on my keyboard, with the exception of the drums, which comes 
	from a built in GarageBand loop (I do play the keyboard drums for the transition and swing portion beginning from 3:12 onward).
	A fretless bass sound and a Fender Rhodes piano sound round out the rhythm section (although I do transition to an upright 
	bass for the swing at the end). For the main melody, I use a brass section sound. The introduction, subsequent background riff, and
	blues improvisation at the end is played by tenor sax sound with a "wah wah" effect. The wah wah effect was inspired 
	in part by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ub7djHS_A" target="_blank">this awesome</a> wah wah bassoon and tenor sax.
