	Watching the 2013 US Open with some casual golf fans, I realized they only
	wanted one question answered. With that in mind, I built 
	<a href="http://www.istigerwinning.com" target="_blank">www.IsTigerWinning.com</a>. 
	Much to my pleasant surprise, after a tweet and <a 
	href="http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1gfke0/is_tiger_woods_winning/" target="_blank">
	one submission to Reddit</a>, 
	I got over 10,000 Pageviews and 8,000 Unique Visitors in a little over 24 hours! 
	And it even got <a href="http://deadspin.com/keep-track-of-the-goings-on-at-the-u-s-open-right-here-513663115"
	target="_blank">picked up</a> by Deadspin.

	over the remainder of the 2013 season, traffic was highly correlated with how well 
	Tiger was playing.
